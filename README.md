- 👋 Hi, I’m @ad-experimenting-github
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Maths, CS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Physics, Maths, Chemistry for JEE Advanced
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently. But later I'll make a proper ID and will surely collaborate on a lot of things. Currently, I might collaborate on some Physics projects though.
