- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ad-experimenting-github
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Physics, Maths, CS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Physics, Maths, Chemistry for JEE Advanced. I love Physics, Maths. I like Chem too but not THAT much. But anyways I am doing Chem too for JEE. In addition to this my aim is IPHO too. After these in college I'll start pursuing coding stuff.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing currently. But later I'll make a proper ID and will surely collaborate on a lot of things. Currently, I might collaborate on some Physics projects though.
