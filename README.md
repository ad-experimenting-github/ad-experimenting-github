- 👋 Hi, I’m @ad-experimenting-github
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Maths, CS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Physics, Maths, Chemistry for JEE Advanced. I love Physics, Maths. I like Chem too but not THAT much. But anyways I am doing Chem too for JEE.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently. But later I'll make a proper ID and will surely collaborate on a lot of things. Currently, I might collaborate on some Physics projects though.
